## Introduction
With the increasing challenges in agriculture, particularly regarding crop diseases, this project focuses on implementing a deep learning approach for automated disease detection. Using a dataset of various plant diseases, we aim to train a CNN model that can provide quick and accurate diagnoses.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises labeled images of plant leaves affected by different diseases, including:
- Potato Early Blight
- Tomato Leaf Mold
- Corn Gray Leaf Spot
- Apple Scab

This diverse dataset ensures robust training and testing of the model.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project includes:
- Input Layer
- Convolutional Layers
- Activation Functions (ReLU)
- Pooling Layers
- Fully Connected Layers
- Output Layer with Softmax Activation

This architecture enables the model to learn hierarchical features from the images effectively.

## Training Process
The model was trained using a set of training images with the following configurations:
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001

Data augmentation techniques were applied, including rotation, flipping, and zooming, to enhance the model's robustness against variations in the input images.

## Results
After training, the model achieved:
- **Training Accuracy:** 95%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 92%
- **Test Accuracy:** 90%

These results indicate a high level of effectiveness in identifying plant diseases, making it a valuable tool for agricultural practices. The model's precision in diagnosing diseases can significantly reduce crop loss and improve yield management.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in agricultural applications, specifically in plant disease detection. The results obtained highlight the importance of integrating technology in agriculture to ensure food security and sustainability. Future work could explore the use of transfer learning to improve accuracy further and extend the model's capabilities to other plant diseases.
